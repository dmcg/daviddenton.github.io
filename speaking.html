<p>Sharing my experiences around software to others at events and conferences is something I very much enjoy. If you
    would like to engage me in my position as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Kotlin
        Developer Expert</a> or prominent member of the <a href="https://github.com/daviddenton">Open Source</a>
    community to speak at your event/podcast, I would be very happy to discuss it.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights of my previous experiences at conferences and events. You can visit a collection of my
    recorded talks on my <a href="https://dentondav.id/youtube">YouTube channel</a>, and some of the decks are available on <a href="https://dentondav.id/speakerdeck">SpeakerDeck</a>:</p>
