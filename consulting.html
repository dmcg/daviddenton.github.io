<p>
    With over two decades of adventures delivering software, I have extensive experience working on high visibility
    projects in a broad variety of industries, and building the teams to deliver them effectively.
</p>
<p>
    I am a firm believer in promoting collaborative, test-driven approaches to produce elegant, quality-driven solutions
    and am confident in clearing presenting complex concepts to a variety of audiences, from teaching to conference to
    board-level.
</p>
<p>
    If your company or project is considering <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> as an implementation
    technology for either mobile, server or multiplatform environments, my expertise and professional network as a <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Kotlin Developer Expert</a> may be of particular
    interest.
</p>
<p>
    I am available for consultancy engagements to help projects in every phase of their delivery lifecycle, from
    pre-conception of ideas, to hiring advice and team building and even re-orientation for projects that are
    experiencing difficulties. I can even assist to get your Open Source project off the ground in the right way through
    my extensive contributor experiences.
</p>
<p>
    Please get in touch to discuss how I can help your technology teams to deliver more effectively. Alternatively,
    please see the <a href="/training">training offerings</a> which I provide to clients, or engage me as a <a
    href="/speaking">Speaker</a> at your event/podcast.
