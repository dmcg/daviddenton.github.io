<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
    With over two decades of adventures delivering software, I have extensive experience working on high visibility
    projects in a broad variety of industries including Investment and Digital Banking, Government, Internet Provision
    and Academic Publishing. I specialise in building not just the software, but also the teams to deliver them, most
    recently through my work as a Head of Engineering at a digital retail bank.
</p>
<p>
    I am a firm believer in promoting collaborative, test-driven approaches to produce elegant, quality-driven solutions
    and am confident in clearing presenting complex concepts to a variety of audiences, from teaching to conference to
    board-level.

<p>
    I am available for consultancy engagements to help projects in every phase of their delivery lifecycle, from
    pre-conception of ideas, to hiring advice and team building and even re-orientation for projects that are
    experiencing difficulties. I can even assist to get your Open Source project off the ground in the right way through
    my extensive contributor experiences.

<p>
    Please get in touch to discuss how I can help your technology teams to deliver more effectively. Alternatively,
    please see the <a href="/training">training offerings</a> which I provide to clients, or engage me as a <a

<h3>Open Source & http4k</h3>
<p>
    As co-creator of the popular <a href="https://http4k.org">http4k</a> HTTP toolkit, I am especially well placed to
    offer advice on implementation patterns for using the library, and undoubtedly the person best placed in the world
    to advise on testing strategies for projects using it. Although http4k has been designed to be incredibly simple to
    test, there are many patterns and techniques which can help to supercharge your testing effort without coupling
    projects to I have successfully advised and delivered http4k projects into production for banks, global publishing
    houses and most recently governments.

<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>
    I have extensive experience with the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> language, having used it heavily
    since 2015, before the v1 release. If your company or project is considering Kotlin as an implementation
    technology for either mobile, server or multiplatform environments, my expertise and professional network as a <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Kotlin Developer Expert</a> may be of particular
    interest.
</p>

<p>
    I also co-authored a <a href="/training">Real World Kotlin Development Workshop</a> to help developers move
    gradually
    into the language in the smoothest possible way.
