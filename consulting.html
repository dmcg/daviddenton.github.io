<p>
    I am available for consultancy engagements to help projects in every phase of their delivery lifecycle, from
    pre-conception of ideas, to hiring advice and team building and even re-orientation for projects that are
    experiencing difficulties. I can even assist to get your Open Source project off the ground in the right way through
    my extensive contributor experiences.

<h3>Open Source & http4k</h3>
<p>
    As co-creator of the popular <a href="https://http4k.org">http4k</a> HTTP toolkit, I am especially well placed to
    offer advice on implementation patterns for using the library, and undoubtedly the person best placed in the world
    to advise on testing strategies for projects using it. Although http4k has been designed to be incredibly simple to
    test, there are many patterns and techniques which can help to supercharge your testing effort without coupling
    projects to I have successfully advised and delivered http4k projects into production for banks, global publishing
    houses and most recently governments.

<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>
    I have extensive experience with the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> language, having used it heavily
    since 2015, before the v1 release. If your company or project is considering Kotlin as an implementation
    technology for either mobile, server or multiplatform environments, my expertise and professional network as a <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Kotlin Developer Expert</a> may be of particular
    interest.
</p>

<p>
    I also co-authored a <a href="/training">Real World Kotlin Development Workshop</a> to help developers move gradually
    into the language in the smoothest possible way.
