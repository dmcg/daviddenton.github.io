</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Would you love to take full advantage of Java without its verbosity? Wish there was a better way to avoid
    NullPointerExceptions? Want to be able to still rely on first-class tooling and industry support? If so then this
    workshop will show that is now possible.
</p>
<p>
    Kotlin is a statically-typed language focused on conciseness and interoperability with Java. Its primary target is
    the JVM and can also be cross-compiled to JavaScript and native code using LLVM.
</p>
<p>
    In this 2 day workshop you'll learn the languageâ€™s powerful, developer-friendly features, how they relate to what
    you know already, and to safely and incrementally migrate existing Java codebases to Kotlin.
</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>
    Developers who are already using JVM languages such as Java or Scala to deliver either mobile or server-side
    applications.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
    To fully benefit from this workshop, attendees should have prior experience with Java.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the exercises will use IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment.
</p>
<p>
    This is a highly practical workshop so attendees should bring their laptop setup with a Java 8 development
    environment installed.
</p>

<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Apply a range of language features to write smaller, more straightforward and safer code.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of the practical interoperability with Java to migrate existing code to Kotlin safely and
        effectively.
    </li>
    <li>Learn several IntelliJ intentions and refactoring tricks for increased productivity.</li>
    <li>Follow the language's functional approaches and promote immutability and declarative code style.</li>
</ul>
